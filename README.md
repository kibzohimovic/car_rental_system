A car rental management system (CRMS) streamlines operations for car rental companies. It manages reservations, fleet, pricing, customer data, maintenance, and reporting. 
CRMS enhances efficiency, customer service, and profitability, making it a vital tool in the car rental industry for optimizing operations and maximizing revenue.
